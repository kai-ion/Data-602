Q1. What are the different types of machine learning? 
"""
q1 = """Answer: 
There are several types of machine learning, each with special characteristics and applications. Some of the main types of machine learning algorithms are as follows:
- Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data, learning the relationship between input features and target outputs (e.g., classification, regression).
- Unsupervised Learning: The model finds patterns and relationships in data without labeled outcomes (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).
- Semi-Supervised Learning: A combination of labeled and unlabeled data is used, where the model learns from a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.
- Reinforcement Learning: An agent interacts with an environment and learns to make decisions by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

Q2. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning? When would you use one method over another?
"""
q2 = """Answer:
- Supervised Learning: The model is provided with labeled training data (input-output pairs) to learn the mapping from inputs to outputs. 
Use supervised learning when you have labeled data and need to predict outcomes, such as predicting stock prices or classifying emails.
- Unsupervised Learning: The model is provided with data that does not have labeled outputs. It looks for patterns or groupings in the data. 
Use unsupervised learning when you want to find patterns or groupings in unlabeled data, like customer segmentation or anomaly detection.
