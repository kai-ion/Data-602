**Q2. Why is this dataset interesting? Why do you want to analyze it?**

The NFL dataset (1999-2022) provides a comprehensive collection of statistics from the NFL over multiple seasons, making it valuable for understanding trends in team performance, player stats, and game outcomes. It is interesting because of the potential to explore data-driven insights into the impact of player performance on team success, uncover emerging patterns in play strategies, and evaluate how the game has evolved over time. I want to analyze it to identify key factors contributing to team wins and assess performance trends across positions.
