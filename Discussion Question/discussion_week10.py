Q1. What is matplottlib and seaborn?  When would you choose one over the other?
Matplotlib is a python plotting library in Python that lets you change appearance of charts, while Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and offers built-in themes and aesthetics for visualizations. Seaborn is easer to use and has more appealing graphs, whereas Matplotlib is better for customization.
